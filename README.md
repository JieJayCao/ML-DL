## My notebooks in university about machine learning and deep learning.
### SVM: The project of the lab built by 360 enterprise security group.
SVM改进版 achieves the goal of mixing the process of traning and distinguishing. The SVM.py can train the model and adjust the parameter at the same time.

### Nerual network: MNIST handwriting recogntion.
Studying in nerual network through google tensorflow, and using mnist as a simple program to ubderstand many kinds of ways which can optimize the model. I learned the different math problems and relize the specific principle.
