# ML-DL
## My notebooks in university about machine learning and deep learning.
### SVM: [The project of the lab built by 360 enterprise security group.](https://github.com/JieJayCao/ML-DL/tree/master/SVM%E6%94%B9%E8%BF%9B%E7%89%88)
SVM改进版 achieves the goal of mixing the process of traning and distinguishing. The SVM.py can train the model and adjust the parameter at the same time.

### [Nerual network: MNIST handwriting recogntion.](https://github.com/JieJayCao/ML-DL/tree/master/Intro%20DL/TensorFlow%E8%AE%AD%E7%BB%83%E7%A5%9E%E7%BB%8F%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C)
Studying in nerual network through google tensorflow, and using mnist as a simple program to understand many kinds of ways which can optimize the model. I learned the different math problems and relize the specific principle.
